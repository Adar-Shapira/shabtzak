# ✅ App Setup Complete!

## What Has Been Done

✅ **NPM packages installed** - All Tauri dependencies are ready  
✅ **Tauri configuration** - Desktop app fully configured  
✅ **PWA manifest** - Web app can be installed as PWA  
✅ **Vite configuration** - Optimized for both web and desktop  
✅ **Setup script created** - Automated setup checker (`setup-app.ps1`)  
✅ **Documentation** - Complete guides in `APP_SETUP.md` and `QUICK_START.md`

## Current Status

⚠️ **Rust not installed** - Required for Tauri desktop app  
⚠️ **Icons missing** - Required before building desktop app  
⚠️ **TypeScript warnings** - Some unused variables (non-blocking)

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Run as PWA (No Rust Needed) ✅

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5173` - you can install it as a PWA!

### Option 2: Set Up Desktop App

1. **Install Rust:**
   - Download from: https://rustup.rs/
   - Or run: `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64" -OutFile "rustup-init.exe"; .\rustup-init.exe`
   - Restart terminal after installation

2. **Generate Icons:**
   ```bash
   # Create a 512x512px PNG of your app icon, then:
   npx @tauri-apps/cli icon path/to/your-icon-512x512.png
   ```

3. **Run Desktop App:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure backend is running on port 8000 first!
   npm run tauri:dev
   ```

4. **Build for Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri:build
   ```
   Installed will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check setup status
.\setup-app.ps1

# Run web app (PWA)
npm run dev

# Run desktop app (after Rust + icons)
npm run tauri:dev

# Build desktop app
npm run tauri:build
```

## Notes

- Backend must be running on `http://localhost:8000` (or set `VITE_API_URL`)
- TypeScript warnings won't prevent the app from running
- Tauri creates smaller, faster apps than Electron
- PWA works immediately - no installation needed
